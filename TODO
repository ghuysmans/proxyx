bulletproof with many useful tests:
	curl/wget (it must be able to use an HTTP proxy)
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer
	CMake integration
well-documented API
conventions:
	0 means success
	indent with tabs
sockets:
	avoid repetition (getaddrinfo, etc.)
	comprehensive error messages (file, syscall)
maybe hashtable for HTTP headers:
	http://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/
	optional support in CMake (option)
	credits!
scripted Lua Web interface:
	API for easy settings management
	ugly but usable samples (default)
	credits for the interpreter!
